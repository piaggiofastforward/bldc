/*
  An event service thread based API library called i2cevent supports processing
  slave messages on a dedicated thread.  This facility is built upon the
  low-level driver's asynchronous callback functions described below:

  Each callback function may alter the processing of subsequent I2C
  messages and read requests by calling i2cSlaveReceive() and
  i2cSlaveReply(), respectively.  Further, callbacks may alter their
  i2cSlaveMsg structs in RAM, but only those for their own channel.
  Such changes take immediate affect.  This facility can be used to
  avoid copying message buffers.

  If receive buffers become full or a reply to a read request cannot be
  generated immediately, the relevant I2CSlaveMsg struct may be substituted
  for another whose body pointer is NULL or whose body size is zero.
  Note that, I2CSlaveMsg structs may be modified
  in place within a channel's callbacks to the same effect.

  A NULL body pointer or zero size causes the slave to signal the master node
  to wait by holding the I2C clock signal low, "stretching it", during the next
  transaction to which that I2CSlaveMsg applies.
  The I2C clock resumes only after a i2cSlaveReceive() or i2cSlaveReply() is
  called with an I2CSlaveMsg containing a non-NULL body,
  or after the transaction timeout expires.

  Therefore, if a NULL body pointer is replaced with a non-NULL one or
  a zero length is replaced with a non-zero one, i2cSlaveReceive() or
  i2cSlaveReply() MUST be called -- even if with the same pointer values --
  to inform the i2c driver that the transaction may resume.

  Note that Receive and Reply processing is initially "locked".
