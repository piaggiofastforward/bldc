TODO for VESC:

important:
- rectify usage of encoder angles vs encoder ticks for pid loop (speed and position)
- develop UART position control
- test encoder as position control source
- test encoder as speed control source
- develop torque control (via current feedback)
   - this loop will be run on the linux side, right? so we want the VESC to report current readings as feedback and we will adjust on our side?
- test torque control

less important:
- provide a configuration for linear balance motor so that we can config over UART
- figure out the differences between rmotor and lmotor (probably one is inverted??), introduce code to handle those differences (or use
  separate lmotor and
